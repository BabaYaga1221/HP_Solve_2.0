R2L37JN9QDX6ML,"The most confusing dilemma an user would face when looking for a printer - LASER OR INKJET.. A Question with a lot of sub-questions...1) INITIAL EXPENSE(High Product Expense) or AFTER PURCHASE EXPENSE(high ink costs)?2) Black & White or COLOR?3) Single Function or Multi Function?Before i start sharing my experience on this one, let me share my past, my previous printer experience- one of the most terrible and bitter experiences i had in my life and that too because of another world class company's product - EPSON ME 340 INKJET MULTIFUNCTION PRINTER..After doing extensive research on several brands(HP,Canon,Epson) and types(Laser and Inkjet) of printers, i made a most terrible  decision - to purchase EPSON ME 340. I don't believe in bad luck or fate..it was only because,i made some slight miscalculations or may be my whole research was on the wrong side.. :(My primary intention was to get a printer for home use- to satisfy my academic printing requirements. The reasons which influenced me in making my decision were1) At that time, EPSON was the only one supporting 3rd Party Ink Tanks, so less printing cost can be achieved and that too with a Multi Function Color Printer.2) The crooked salesman at my local IT shop cheated me by giving a false promise, that installing a 3rd Party Company tank won't affect my product's guarantee. he also said he had handled several similar cases without any issues..  I was totally trusting this guy...3) Last but not least..i was so much blindly obsessed with brand EPSON's reputation..Guess what happened? After spending an eye whooping amount of around 5600Rs (3800+ For Printer and 1800+ for ink tank),My printer stopped working just after 6 months of usage. When i called the IT shop, they totally refused their earlier words and offers in providing the assistance in claiming guarantee and they told me that it's main board of the printer that became faulty and in order to make it work again,i should spend another 3000+ and when i contacted company service, they refused to provide me guarantee due to additional modifications which i have made to the printer.. well i don't blame them, standard company regulations.. it was my fault to believe that crooked mind...NOW ABOUT THE PRESENT......After a year, due to heavy printing requirements(Final year project documentation,seminar, reference materials,etc) i thought of purchasing another printer again. This time i have made a firm decision at the beginning itself..i will purchase from a reputed online seller. After my detailed comparison tests and scrutinies, found 2 best devices to suit my needs- HP 2520hc and Canon Image Class MF 3010.Out of these two,i finally decided to go with canon because1) i have very good experience with two canon products before(canon ixus digital camera) and canon projector.2) Most of the other online sellers were offering these printers for prices near to their MRPs without any substantial discounts, but when i saw the price of canon MF 3010 @ amazon i was astonished.... around 24% discount to MRP...7650Rs instead of 9900Rs.Initial Experience--> Printing Quality is excellent...Very fast printing compared to slow inkjet printers(First paper out in less than 5-7 seconds)..Can't talk about toner mileage since i have printed only few papers..Scanning Quality is one of the best among this class of printers... An amazing feature i found in the copier other than normal copy is to select 3 modes-1) Paper Save(2 papers on one side) or Card Copier(to take the copies of small identity cards)2) Brightness adjustment(to set density of black color, by this way we can effectively increase the mileage of toner bin)3) Enlargement( could easily set the screen ration of the copying process either 50% to around 200%)The only con which i found in this printer so far is the absence of duplex printing feature (2 sided printing at the same time)..In overall i would definitely recommend this to any one looking for a home printer which could produce cheap prints..You can simply purchase it without even thinking...Because, that's the level of trust Canon is offering here...

RBJ4X54JDLZM3,"I bought this printer two years ago and last week the drum unit on my printer needed to be replaced after printing 11786 pages in the past two years, which is pretty accurate with what was promised (12000 pages).In the meantime, I used eight toners, which implies that this printer can on an average print 1500 pages with one original toner, which is not bad considering the price of the toner being on the lower side.On the operation side, the printer is pretty seamless with very rare occurrence of paper jam. My printer statistics says it occured only 30 times during the life the last drum.So I was looking for buying it again as I was in need of another printer. But the price on Amazon totally shocked me. Two years back I bought it for Rs 8999 which was not any special deal. Back then the MRP of the product was quite low. If I remember correctly it was in the tune of Rs 11000.Now seeing the 63% rise in the MRP I became quite suspicious. So, I look around on the website of Brother which lists it with a price of Rs. 13990. I asked around in the retail offline market and they said it is available for Rs 11500.So it makes no sense to buy it from Amazon with such a high price difference. I don't know how Amazon regulates the prices of the items on its platform, but by seeing all this I can definitely say that this needs to be fixed.Otherwise a great printer.Edit: While I wrote this review, MRP of the printer on Amazon was Rs. 17900 and it was being sold for Rs. 15000 on discount.",bought printer years ago week drum unit printer needed replaced printing 11786 pages past years pretty accurate promised 12000 pagesin meantime used toners implies printer average print 1500 pages original toner bad considering price toner lower sideon operation printer pretty seamless rare occurrence paper jam printer statistics says occured 30 times life drumso looking buying need printer price amazon totally shocked years bought rs 8999 special deal mrp product quite low remember correctly tune rs 11000now seeing 63 rise mrp quite suspicious look website brother lists price rs 13990 asked retail offline market said available rs 11500so makes sense buy amazon high price difference dont know amazon regulates prices items platform seeing definitely say needs fixedotherwise great printeredit wrote review mrp printer amazon rs 17900 sold rs 15000 discount

R1SGH0DSSHJ69,"¬†Estamos ante una impresora port√°til que es un concepto muy interesante ya que tener la posibilidad de poder revelar las fotos en pocos segundos, donde queramos ya que es de peque√±o tama√±o, ligera y nos cabe en cualquier sitio, la calidad de las fotos es solo aceptable desarrollo con m√°s detalle este punto un poco m√°s adelante.A m√≠ me personalmente me ha gustado mucho, desde la construcci√≥n que es muy buena, bien acabada con un gran acabado superficial. En cuando al dise√±o es muy bonita.Tiene un peso de solo 170 gramos, con unas dimensiones de 11,5 x 7,49 x 2,21 cm, es muy peque√±a.En cuanto a la calidad fotogr√°fica de las fotos a de decir que es media baja la verdad, los colores est√°n muy apagados en las pruebas, pero no est√°n mala del todo el problema est√° realmente en los colores que no son fieles a la realidad. Decir como contrapartida que la calidad de las fotos pensado que es un impresora sin tinta, con bater√≠a adem√°s de port√°til  est√° muy bien.

RL5G8Q6VZNOFD,"10 Words or Less:‚Ä¢ Faster than ZIP, higher quality, compatible with Zink papers*IMPORTANT:‚Ä¢ If you read just ONE thing, read this. DO NOT THROW OUT THE BLUE CARD in the starter paper pack! I repeat DO NOT THROW OUT THE BLUE CARD!‚Ä¢ Take a look at my photo and you‚Äôll see there are different kinds of blue cards that are included with paper. The blue card is read each time you insert a new pack and it tells the printer what paper is there. It is VERY IMPORTANT to know that the hp sprocket will only accept HP branded paper! This means you cannot use regular (cheaper) Zink Pogo paper or Zink Premium. How does the printer know what paper you have? The blue card.‚Ä¢ Whatever 2x3‚Äù Zink paper you buy, simply feed the ORIGINAL HP blue card instead of the one that came in the package. The printer will read it as hp sprocket paper and accept it. This is nothing more than manufacturers trying to limit the use to their own ‚Äúlicensed‚Äù paper. Now there IS a difference between the regular ‚ÄúPogo‚Äù paper and ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù but there is no difference between brands like ‚ÄúLG‚Äù or ‚ÄúHP‚Äù or ‚ÄúPolaroid‚Äù‚Ä¶ they are the same.The Good:‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs FAST! By fast I mean the spool up time to print is a full 20 seconds LESS than the Polaroid Zip.‚Ä¢ Quality is better‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the printer or the app, but the output is far better on the HP (in general). Polaroid Zip prints are generally much too dark, even after editing.‚Ä¢ The HP app is much more user friendly than the Polaroid ‚ÄúSnapTouch‚Äù app.The Bad:‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs slightly bigger than the Polaroid Zip.‚Ä¢ HP app does NOT have multi photo printing on one page. You have to use a third party app like PhotoGrid and then send the output to HP sprocket app. This is can be a hinderance from someone that likes to print 2-in-1 pics.‚Ä¢ Casing is very glossy so I suggest getting it in white if you don‚Äôt like to see fingerprint smudges.Comments and Last Thoughts:‚Ä¢ There are two kinds of paper: Regular (Zink Pogo), and Premium (Zink Premium, HP sprocket‚Ä¶etc). The latter is a little bit higher quality and more glossy. For me, the cost isn‚Äôt worth it for a print this size and how it‚Äôs going to be used anyway. I suggest going for the regular kind and buying in bulk if you want to save some money.‚Ä¢ If you‚Äôre looking for a decent price on Premium paper, look to the Apple Store or deals that happen on Best Buy and Amazon. YOU MUST KEEP THE ORIGINAL HP BLUE PAPER TO USE IT.‚Ä¢ For bulk papers, I‚Äôve purchased from Amazon regular Pogo (not Premium) papers like this:¬†",10 words less‚Ä¢ faster zip higher quality compatible zink papersimportant‚Ä¢ read just thing read throw blue card starter paper pack repeat throw blue card‚Ä¢ look photo you‚Äôll different kinds blue cards included paper blue card read time insert new pack tells printer paper important know hp sprocket accept hp branded paper means use regular cheaper zink pogo paper zink premium does printer know paper blue card‚Ä¢ 2x3‚Äù zink paper buy simply feed original hp blue card instead came package printer read hp sprocket paper accept manufacturers trying limit use ‚Äúlicensed‚Äù paper difference regular ‚Äúpogo‚Äù paper ‚Äúpremium‚Äù difference brands like ‚Äúlg‚Äù ‚Äúhp‚Äù ‚Äúpolaroid‚Äù‚Ä¶ samethe good‚Ä¢ it‚Äôs fast fast mean spool time print 20 seconds polaroid zip‚Ä¢ quality better‚Ä¶ i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs printer app output far better hp general polaroid zip prints generally dark editing‚Ä¢ hp app user friendly polaroid ‚Äúsnaptouch‚Äù appthe bad‚Ä¢ it‚Äôs slightly bigger polaroid zip‚Ä¢ hp app does multi photo printing page use party app like photogrid send output hp sprocket app hinderance likes print 2in1 pics‚Ä¢ casing glossy suggest getting white don‚Äôt like fingerprint smudgescomments thoughts‚Ä¢ kinds paper regular zink pogo premium zink premium hp sprocket‚Ä¶etc little bit higher quality glossy cost isn‚Äôt worth print size it‚Äôs going used suggest going regular kind buying bulk want save money‚Ä¢ you‚Äôre looking decent price premium paper look apple store deals happen best buy amazon original hp blue paper use it‚Ä¢ bulk papers i‚Äôve purchased amazon regular pogo premium papers like
R3E6UO3TT2BJHS,"Just got it. Here are some (hopefully) time-saving tips and observations I 'learned' from test running this thing:First, there's no printed manual with this. Just a blue card instructing you to go to hpsprocket.com -- which is pretty thin in technical details, but there is a basic setup guide there. And the guide at that site is not all that well written either. For instance, I thought that the 'blue card' was the calibration card, but no -- that's inside the paper pack, the card in the box is just, I presume, a laughingly minimal compliance to supplying printed support material? (the QR code didn't even work!)Anyhow, when I did figure out how to open the unit to put the paper in, I saw the calibration card and made sure it was face down when inserting into the unit. Someone wisely suggested hanging onto this card and maybe adding something like 'Original Card [date of purchase]' on its back. That bar code is essentially the 'key' to allowing the printer to know that you've just inserted HP Brand Zink paper in it, even though there's no real difference between paper brands, but you need that card to 'hack' the printer into accepting other brand papers. (Might be worth making a copy and -- as a way to remind yourself to not throw it away, reinsert it to the top of the back after the printer does it's initial 'brand' testing of the card).After fully charing the Sprocket, I installed the software and added the device in my bluetooth settings on my Android Samsung Note 4. The device showed up no problem as a paired device, but when I clicked on it in the list to connect, nothing happened. It was paired, but not connected. A couple of hours later.... I had managed to update the firmware of the device (through the app settings) and I also learned that the connection is not made until actual print time. Ah! Major breakthrough! When I actually opened a phot in the app and hit print, it said it couldn't connect. Then when I opened the print queue, and hit print, it did connect, and print. Whew! So obviously, not all the bugs were killed in that firmware upgrade.In any case, I now had a workflow that... kind of worked.I also plan to use this at an event to promote good will, and a brand. I'm doing that by 'printing' through the Share button from an app called 'Add Watermark'. This app allows you to load up saved, customized PNGs as Watermarks, but to get a 'customized branded frame' for each print, I constructed a decorative border frame (with a logo and text on the bottom) and loaded it in as a watermark into Add Watermark and scaled it to fill side to side. As the Sprocket's print ratio is 2:3, and not one available on most cameras, the overlay frame (which is set to 2:3 ratio) gets instantly centered with one button push and reveals 'unframed' picture bottom and top. No worries, as the next step is to use the 'Share' button in Add Watermark to send it to the HP Sprocket app where it pops in fitting perfectly, ready to print.But print through the Print Queue button only, for some reason.Another lesson I learned is that you cannot 'compensate' for the drop in vividness of colours between screen and printout using the Sprocket App's brightness/contrast tweaks found in its 'Edit Image' controls. Best to get as crisp and bright as you would normally want in a print before passing oft to the Sprocket app, and just lower your contrast and colour expectations.Everyone I've shown the system to so far is next to incredulous of the printer's size and output quality. I expect this should work well for the event we have planned. And just as an overall fun, party toy.But HP needs to step up their game here (and most of their other products, from what I hear) for customer support service.And if I had a big druther -- I'd hope that they would update the Sprocket app to include importing of full colour PNG images (with transparency) as user supplied customized 'stickers' to work as customizes frames within that app (rather than the awkward workaround through a separate app). The ability to add a logo or a frame, text, or tagline to each print potentially transforms this little toy into a real charming, little pocket brand builder.To that end, be sure to consider creating a nice quality PNG file of your business card! The standard bus. card is 3.5 x 2 inches. That means these 'prints' from the Sprocket are just a half inch short, but they should fit in most people's card organizers. How about leaving an area left to throw in a selfi shot with your contact? Now that might make more of an unconscious impression than you would think. How many times have you tried to put a face to a business card? By using the selfie 'platform' you can instantly create a card with your face and your contact together. Personalized business cards? Hmm.Oh, everyone loves the sticker option on the prints too. Great little feature!Zink paper refills still baffles me.

R3Q8IKRO27A9MM,"I researched and looked at many portable printers for several months, before deciding on the HP sprocket. I wasn‚Äôt sure whether I should go with the sprocket or the plus but chose the original. I know that reviews can be biased,  as bad reviews can result when someone has an issue with software update, installing paper the correct way, etc. I tried not to let the ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt work‚Äù reviews dissuade me from my purchase and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt. If you go to the App Store, you will see many complaints about app and printer not working - apparently there was an app issue months ago that involved an update and a reset of phone and printer- very simple fix that hp addressed.I had viewed several YouTube videos so that when my sprocket arrived I was pretty familiar with what would be in the box and what I needed to do. So simple- remove cover of printer, put the pack of 10 sheets of paper in with the blue card at the bottom facing down (this calibrates the printer). Then, on your phone, install the app. From there, the app will ask you which device you have. Select it and it will walk you through each step, such as your photo roll and accessing your social media accounts if you‚Äôd like to (so make sure you know your usernames for Instagram and Facebook, etc) Make sure on you‚Äôre phone your blue tooth is turned on. I have an iPhone X and cannot tell you how seamless this was. It will tell you when printer and phone are paired. Done! I couldn‚Äôt believe how easy it is and - for the record- I am not the most tech savvy grape in the bunch, ha ha. If I could do it, anyone reading my review will be able to do it!  Then, give it a charge. You will see a red light. Red light means it‚Äôs charging. When the light is green, it‚Äôs charged. You‚Äôre good to go! If a software/ firmware update is needed the printer needs to be charged 50%. The printer needs to be charged a bit before printing out a picture so keep that in mind as well. I am over the moon with this, I‚Äôm so happy I bought it! I also purchased a little hard case to carry it in- and store my papers and charging cord, glad I decided to buy that too. Something to consider if you‚Äôre going to purchase this. If in the fence, I say go for it. The picture printed as I expected it to. Clear. Glossy. Perfect to capture a memory of an event or get together or to tuck into an agenda, wallet, card or journal! Love, love, love this!!!

R2V9VZPN9541SA,"I really like my HP Sprocket and I hope HP continues to support it. The App for this is really simple to use but they need more options because I have to use a third party app to have more editing options.So the printer itself is pretty swell. Don't expect amazing quality though, you gonna put most pictures though the editor to brighten/darken it to make it closer to the original. Also, dark lines aren't very consistent. I'm currently using this to print comics sections and artwork for my sketch book as reference and in one of the pictures I printed out before editing, it was suppose to be just black and white but the black lines were faded and kinda tinted purplish I think. Very light. In another drawing I printed, I used the editor and it came out a bit better. For such a large picture turned tiny, it got most of the details. Just the black lines were faded/light purplish in the thinner lines.BTW, I would suggest using this app for iOS users if you want to make sure all of your picture will fit in the 2:3 ration that the app uses: "">Resize"". It's free and pretty basic in the Apple App Store. Pretty much uses all of the paper and looks decent if you remain consistant. Oh, and you have to be using the latest iOS firmware of your device cause the HP decided to stop supporting those under 8.0 I think.So I'm not sure if the picture quality is the HP Sprocket's fault or the Zink Paper since they're both pretty new. I hope the paper becomes cheaper cause unless it's on a sale, it's about $0.50 per paper. The sticker part is really good though, picture feels smooth against my sketch book and doesn't come loose.So overall, if you just want some fun little pictures for your scrapbook/sketch book needs, I would suggest buying it since it seems like the best out of the other current printers of April 2017. It's very easy to connect it to your bluetooth and the app is simple to use as well. It's very portable and there are two cases for it right now for your basic needs of protection. There is also the benefit that since it uses Zink paper like Polaroid and LG, you could swap between the other brands as long as you keep your blue sheet from the HP set. Look it up on YouTube if you want proof.The only other recommendation I would give is the Kodak Mini Printer (PM-210). The pictures are a tiny bit bigger than a credit card and the quality is pretty good. Only problem is the cartiages as they are quite expensive unless you use another brand like ""Pickit"" which comes in non-sticker and sticker.I'll include a photo of my Sprocket with the two cases I'm using and a screenshot I printed from Person 5 the game.",really like hp sprocket hope hp continues support app really simple use need options use party app editing optionsso printer pretty swell dont expect amazing quality gonna pictures editor brightendarken make closer original dark lines arent consistent im currently using print comics sections artwork sketch book reference pictures printed editing suppose just black white black lines faded kinda tinted purplish think light drawing printed used editor came bit better large picture turned tiny got details just black lines fadedlight purplish thinner linesbtw suggest using app ios users want make sure picture fit 23 ration app uses resize free pretty basic apple app store pretty uses paper looks decent remain consistant oh using latest ios firmware device cause hp decided stop supporting 80 thinkso im sure picture quality hp sprockets fault zink paper theyre pretty new hope paper cheaper cause unless sale 050 paper sticker really good picture feels smooth sketch book doesnt come looseso overall just want fun little pictures scrapbooksketch book needs suggest buying like best current printers april 2017 easy connect bluetooth app simple use portable cases right basic needs protection benefit uses zink paper like polaroid lg swap brands long blue sheet hp set look youtube want proofthe recommendation kodak mini printer pm210 pictures tiny bit bigger credit card quality pretty good problem cartiages quite expensive unless use brand like pickit comes nonsticker stickerill include photo sprocket cases im using screenshot printed person 5 game

R2AU6V6VZJX5TV,"Ero rimasta incuriosita da questa stampante sentendone parlare gi√† prima del suo lancio e, soprattutto, ero spesso tentata nell'acquisto di una macchina fotografica instantanea. Ma l'Hp Sprocket ha superato tutte le aspettative.Appena aperto il pacco ho trovato questa stampante tascabile (poco pi√π larga di un normale smartphone), di colore nero e dalla finitura extra lucida elegante e sfiziosa, assieme ad una ricarica di carta fotografica.All'interno, nessun foglio di istruzioni: la Hp Sprocket, infatti, √® assolutamente intuitiva e di facilissimo utilizzo. Sul lato sinistro c'√® un tasto di accensione, mentre le spie posteriori indicano quando la stampante √® accesa (luce bianca) oppure necessita di essere ricaricata (luce rossa), con un cavo usb in dotazione. Per ricaricare la carta, invece, basta spingere leggermente il cassetto superiore con il pollice e inserire la carta con il lato blu rivolto verso il basso. Ho poi scaricato sul mio telefono l'app ""sprocket"" ed ecco la magia! Si possono prendere le foto dalla galleria del telefono o dai vari social, magari modificandola con filtri, testi, cornici o stickers! La stampa - che avviene tramite bluetooth - √® abbastanza veloce, su carta fotografica adesiva di 5x7,6 cm. La novit√† sta proprio nella carta: non esistono cartucce, perch√® grazie alla nuova tecnologia Zink l'inchiostro √® direttamente nella carta! La qualit√† √® buona e i colori sono nitidi e lucidi e mi sembrano anche parecchio resistenti, ma √® bene ricordare che si tratta di foto istantanee e che, pertanto, nella stampa la qualit√† un po' si abbassa. Se non ci si aspetta foto super professionali, dunque, l'Hp Sprocket rimane un'ottima scelta.Ho portato la mia Sprocket davvero ovunque: pranzi in famiglia, serate con amici, eventi pubblici e, soprattutto, ho stampato le sorprese da inserire nelle uova di cioccolato che ho realizzato quest'anno e, devo ammetterlo, tutti sono rimasti sbalorditi da queste piccole foto ricordo, tanto da voler conoscere e provare da s√® questa stampante.Ho usato talmente tanto la mia Sprocket che ho terminato quasi subito la carta a disposizione e ho quindi ordinato due ricariche nello store Hp (da cui si pu√≤ accedere direttamente dalla app). Anche in questo caso sono rimasta piacevolmente sorpresa, ho ricevuto il mio ordine in 24 ore!La mia esperienza con l'Hp Sprocket, quindi, √® assolutamente positiva e pi√π di qualche amico mi ha confessato di volerla acquistare tanto son rimasti incuriositi!

R2NCGCELK4XKDJ,"After a day of fidgeting with the wifi settings and constantly getting disconnected, I was finally able to get the printer to work in USB mode. In this process, wasted 10 pages just to get it working.The printer comes with useless manuals, and expects you to print most of it. Recommend not using HP Smart - the software is a time waste.Build quality of printer is flimsy...can break easily...handle with care. I was used to my well built k209a.Out of the box, the printer is in wifi mode, and you end up wasting (printing) 1 page everytime the wifi direct password changes. It needs a wpa enabled router to work on lan.As the installation driver is no longer provided on CD, you need to download a 150~mb software from HP website - this enables USB direct printing. And you can disable wifi and internet printing. It also allows you to print and scan directly from Windows with bundled HP software (not HP Smart).Overall 4 star for the printer as it has plenty of features for the price point. But 2 stars for the installation and setup process.",day fidgeting wifi settings constantly getting disconnected finally able printer work usb mode process wasted 10 pages just workingthe printer comes useless manuals expects print recommend using hp smart software time wastebuild quality printer flimsycan break easilyhandle care used built k209aout box printer wifi mode end wasting printing 1 page everytime wifi direct password changes needs wpa enabled router work lanas installation driver longer provided cd need download 150mb software hp website enables usb direct printing disable wifi internet printing allows print scan directly windows bundled hp software hp smartoverall 4 star printer plenty features price point 2 stars installation setup process

R51STDNXIGJQ4,"The printer (HP 4826) is nice.1) Printer price is high compared to the HP 2338 series, but makes up in ink cost.2) The colour ink (HP 47) claims 700 pages and costs Rs 475 at the time of writing, whereas most other HP inks costs Rs 800+ but gives only 180 pages! So, in the long run the cost of the printer will be recovered. However HP-47 is a new ink and only used by this printer now, so it may not as easily available as others.3) Can print wirelessly from mobile phone, laptop, desktop as long as they are on the same wired/wireless networkEasy to install.Print quality is acceptable on normal paper, although it looks quite a bit on the lighter side (to save ink/ speed?).If printing from PC, there is option to choose ‚Äúbest‚Äù print quality but it becomes really slow.Print alignment sheet comes after first 3 prints, which needs to be scanned for improving quality. Printing speed is average.Photo printing was OK-OK on JK photo paper.There were no clear instructions on the installation, try watching videos online. Here are the steps1) Open box, remove all blue plastic tapes. Open the paper in and out trays, adjust paper width by lifting the backside tab and pushing the width tab. Load few sheets of A4 paper. Insert the power cable.2) Turn on printer. Open cartridge door. Install both ink cartridges3) Install HP-smart app on mobile phone. The blue light on wireless will be blinking (setup mode, this lasts for 2 hours after first power up, so turn-on only when you are planning to install) With printer on and nearby (and within wireless router range) start installation process, follow instructions.4) Wireless network password would be asked, and also you would have to sign up for HP account.5) Try printing from mobile. Once the printer setup is over, the printer can be added on any Windows-10 PC by using ADD-Printer option in control panel. There is no need to install the HP software on PC, but it has some features, so it is recommended.Overall it an OK printer with an average to low speed vs quality, but promises low ink cost. It is aimed at home use only and will not satify a professional.",printer hp 4826 nice1 printer price high compared hp 2338 series makes ink cost2 colour ink hp 47 claims 700 pages costs rs 475 time writing hp inks costs rs 800 gives 180 pages long run cost printer recovered hp47 new ink used printer easily available others3 print wirelessly mobile phone laptop desktop long wiredwireless networkeasy installprint quality acceptable normal paper looks quite bit lighter save ink speedif printing pc option choose ‚Äúbest‚Äù print quality really slowprint alignment sheet comes 3 prints needs scanned improving quality printing speed averagephoto printing okok jk photo paperthere clear instructions installation try watching videos online steps1 open box remove blue plastic tapes open paper trays adjust paper width lifting backside tab pushing width tab load sheets a4 paper insert power cable2 turn printer open cartridge door install ink cartridges3 install hpsmart app mobile phone blue light wireless blinking setup mode lasts 2 hours power turnon planning install printer nearby wireless router range start installation process follow instructions4 wireless network password asked sign hp account5 try printing mobile printer setup printer added windows10 pc using addprinter option control panel need install hp software pc features recommendedoverall ok printer average low speed vs quality promises low ink cost aimed home use satify professional

R2KRMESPWTBZVK,All well. I used it for regular  personal requirement of b&w printouts as well as color photo prints. All wirelessly using my smartphone.  Expectedly the initial setup with the necessary app required some patience but then it was all smooth enough. All results are of  excellent quality . I like that It's lightweight too. To me the extra ink cartridges seem very convenient as in case a cartridge is used up you won't have to run for a replacement. First time I am using a personal printer at home but my experience with this printer is quite smooth & sweet.,used regular personal requirement bw printouts color photo prints wirelessly using smartphone expectedly initial setup necessary app required patience smooth results excellent quality like lightweight extra ink cartridges convenient case cartridge used wont run replacement time using personal printer home experience printer quite smooth sweet
R2MGG9ILAVZMMP,"¬†Print quality is good . It is easy to use , but i cannot send command through my pc , while sending the print command it is getting stuck through wifi , so i am using my phone to get the printouts , specially the wireless connectivity is very good , till now i have not faced any major problem , bought this printer last week . The cost of printing is very minimum which is the actual advantage of this printer . After searching on youtube i did not get any detailed video of this printer so i have to figure it out through the owner's mannual which is not so tough to understand . As per iso standards it is mentioned that the black and white cartridge can yield 2600 pages but they have not mentioned in which quality of printing either in draft or normal or  in best . I will prefer everyone to buy this printer , the price of the cartridge is also low when it is compared with other cartridges .By the way i got one hp gaming headphone for free with this printer , which nearly cost around Rs 1350 üòÄüòÄ and i trust hp because they try to give their best in each and every product .

R35Y4SPKWPS1XI,"Bought this printer 10 days ago. Setting up this printer to connect to Wifi and then connecting mobiles and laptops to this printer is a nightmare even for a software Engineer like me.Pros :1. Print quality is good.Cons :1. Connecting to Wifi is a trouble.2. The Hp Smart app does not allow you to print unless you register an account with HP. Not just that, every user and device - laptop and mobile has to register and be logged in to print.3. The account gets logged out everyday and have to relogin again.4. Installed HP Smart and drivers on my laptop. It asked me to login 3 times and enter the printer pin 2 times.5. When I logged into another user account on same laptop, I had to go through the same login processes again. Why HP why ????6. HP smart app does not have photo resizing option to fit to A4. So have to send the photo from mobile to desktop, resize to A4 and then send to mobile for printing.My recommendation - Do not buy .",bought printer 10 days ago setting printer connect wifi connecting mobiles laptops printer nightmare software engineer like mepros 1 print quality goodcons 1 connecting wifi trouble2 hp smart app does allow print unless register account hp just user device laptop mobile register logged print3 account gets logged everyday relogin again4 installed hp smart drivers laptop asked login 3 times enter printer pin 2 times5 logged user account laptop login processes hp 6 hp smart app does photo resizing option fit a4 send photo mobile desktop resize a4 send mobile printingmy recommendation buy

R2ZI8WSIKGOUXM,"Printer:It's meant for regular and perhaps heavy use.The amount of ink provided wouldn't be utilised even in many years with occasional use.It stopped working after about two and half years, perhaps because of low use (ink dried in the line and/or printer head). I would suggest to use the printer head cleaning software option once every few months if you are not using it regularly, to avoid having printer issues due to clogged lines due to dried ink.It doesn't print on both sides of the pages on its own. You have to print one page then feed it again manually if you want to print on both the sides, which is cumbersome.So, consider a printer with feature of duplex printing if you intend to print large no. of pages on regular basis, to avoid wasting paper by leaving one side unused.Photo printing:I tried it only for a few photos. Quality seems okay but not great. But I am no expert on this and I don't have much experience with photo printing at home.Scanner:it's good, no complaint about resolution/performance. However, S/w is not very user friendly.If the document is faded, it's difficult to choose the best mode from many scan modes available.Photocopier:works well - both colour and black & White modes.OnsiteGo Warranty (purchased along with printer)I had taken extended warranty for 2 years from OnsiteGo which repaired it free of any charges.Their service was very smooth and convenient as they picked it and delivered to my home after a day or two.So, it was a quick and convenient service.The only issue I came across with OnsiteGo is that their pick up guy didn't have any Identity card or authorisation letter from the company, so it was difficult to ascertain the authenticity of the service person whlle allowing him to take the printer away. It caused some inconvenience but I handed over the unit after some phone calls and email exchanges with the support team.I would recommend to go for OnsiteGo warranty particularly for items like printers, so that you get door step service in case of need.

RZOQFNDZYSUUS,"I have a very bad experience after purchasing this HP Laser Printer 108W  model, the reason because once the toner ink gets finished then there is no option for cartridge/toner refill option to this printer model and all together the only option left over is purchasing the new HP toner which will cost you around 3000/-. Ideally the cartridge  refill should not cost more than 200-300 rupees for any other HO Laser printer model.The fact of no refill option was totally hidden when I purchased it through online from Amazon.Even the HP service denied to resolve my issue even though the printer model is in within the warranty period.
