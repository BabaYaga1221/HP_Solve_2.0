R2M2J2N9VW596A,Best for Home use. Can Print easily from Smartphone through WiFi,Good Product for Home use. The only thing is the cost of original ink cartridges which is very higher. The printing cost will be around 5-7 Rs for both B/W & Colour Prints on using original ink cartridges. (Cartridge cost/ No of pages Print)
R24UIGCOHLFHF,I could not install yet. installing is troublesome. Printer appears to be of no use. waste of money.,not used yet because i have wasted two days but could not install. Installation is not responding.
RV749GYXKKGM7,"Spend a little more, buy a different / better product.","This is a product made specifically be sold cheap so that Canon can sell ink at exorbitant prices. The plastic is the cheapest I have seen on a branded consumer product. Have lost respect for Canon seeing the flimsy, non-homogenous material all around.Some brilliant person decided to give a fine chequered texture to the top surface of a product which predominantly sits in the open. The texture accumulates dust like a magnet and holds on to it for the rest of its life. The same surface also holds on to the sticker adhesive & packing foam reside.  No, you can‚Äôt clean it, even with an ear bud soaked in isopropyl alcohol.The description stated duplex printing. But there is no paper tray. And no, there is no automatic double sided printing. You need to manual flip the pages over like prehistoric times.Once you install all the associated Canon software, be prepared to be bombarded with notifications / survey requests etc with every breath you take."
RXEW897RKTK1R,Works Ok once installed but the wifi printing feature is a pain to install,Instructions for installing the wifi print feature are really confusing and we couldnt get it to work with an iMac. Finally we installed it from an Android phone. Once installed from Phone then we saw it on the network for iMac as well. Otherwise its a good printer at a cheap price.
R150ZWVR2Q7XU2,Best printer in this budget,Best printer in this budget. Value for the money
R9X923VV8BL1D,Good quality in this budget,The cartridge size is too small for ink
R2HS7XYYKY4E1A,Aim not sor,Value for money to Nahin Hai
R19XHUR380FQZO,Recommended for very light use,"Biggest drawback is that the ink doesn't last long enough, just took 10 prints and black ink is showing half empty.Wireless works perfectly fine.Little complicated to setup wireless but worth the effort.The printer surface catches dust very easily."
R3ML0D623RU2E,Good product at a reasonable price,"This a simple, low cost solution for printing at home. It also copies and scans. Well made (after all a Canon product) and easy to install. Works via WiFi, as well as a direct USB connection (that we haven't used). Only negative I have observed it that most of the controls (for printing, scanning and copying) are in the smartphone (or computer) app and not on the printer itself. That is a bit cumbersome when you just want to copy a single page, for example... but overall a good value for money and Iwould buy it again if the need arises."
R1XP1UMEK5XUI,Just okay. Some features are good.,"Negative concern:1. Actually slow printing.2. Huge printing cost(if you manage with ciss it can reduce).3. Black Ink are not waterproof.4. Print quality not too good, just ok quality.5. No duplex printing facility.6. High price @‚Çπ4388/-Positive concern:1.Good WiFi facility, also WPS support (direct connection), mobile friendly. Quick connection after plugin.2.Can print thick paper(photo glossy 2, vinyl).2.Easy and efficient paper size selection.3.Borderless printing.4.Best printing resolution in this segment.5.Good scanning resolution.6.Cancel button that immediately stop print/scan oparation.7. Easy to install.8.Easy to Oparate. After plugin, immediately connected devices with WiFi.9.Small LCD display and LED notification"
R2FSEE450KH9VV,Not good quality as per the price,It's not worth 13k INR as this product should be maximum priced at 2000 INR.Does not print on skin at all so no tattoo at all even if you use it with the small printer head tray.Ink doesn't work properly after few prints no matter even if you clean cartridge as guided.App for this printer sucks and doesn't work very well and can't print logos properly and size adjustment is also a problem with this app.Overall it is a 5* rating if it's priced under 2k INR But for the price of 13K INR it's not even worth 1* rating.

R2VGD52TB1R9K0,Excellent Product with Brief Detailing,Excellent Service with good condition of product & sturdy packaging and Brief details about How to use MBrush Printer. Overall excellent service by amazon.
R2GCQKM8427CC,Works after Tinkering,"Initially wanted to return as the ink would dry up quick, then after some research on youtube ( search Mbrush troubleshooting) got it working as intended. Basically you need to wipe its printhead with damp cloth before EACH use to get good color prints. Overall its a marvel of tech for being the smallest color printer that can print everwhere but needs tinkering and practice."
RAU425E5J8GQE,Original Genuine Product,"Amazing product , Great Service."
R10CQ6SJ72535K,Pretty Good,"The quality isn‚Äôt amazing but it‚Äôs pretty good. I have started reading journal and I wanted to print an image of the book covers. They aren‚Äôt grainy, the color is vibrant, and the dark ones actually turned out the best. So far I haven‚Äôt had a single issue and I‚Äôm happy with the pictures. I would recommend."
R11LD6YUL4XC0M,Great for journaling!,"I do artsy bullet journaling, but don't have a printer at home. This is great for when I need pictures on demand in between trips to the library for printing. It connects quickly and the mobile app works well. The sticker photos are thick and glossy. Sometimes there is slight discoloration to what you see on the screen, but overall I am happy with the output. Even if you do several tiny images per sheet, they don't come out blurry."
R3P0HZ3DKTV846,Nicht auf alle Funktionen 4*,"22.12.21 gekauft. Farbqualit√§t ist ganz gut (3 bis 4 von 5*). Seit 1 Monat macht das Teil Probleme: Schwierigkeiten beim anmachen :-/ Erst nach mehreren Versuchen geht das Teilchen an. Nat√ºrlich ist es aus der Garantie raus. (1 von 5*)Von Anfang an fand ich die Akku Laufzeit etwas niedrig. Mich st√∂rt es nicht, sollte man aber wissen, falls man es viel unterwegs benutzen will.Ich habe in den 15 Monaten ca 500 Sticker ausgedruckt. Die Qualit√§t ist gleichbleibend, h√§ngt allerdings auch mit dem Zink-Papier zusammen.Im Gegensatz zu einer anderen Rezension hier, ist von meinen Stickern noch keiner verblasst. Sie kleben auch immer noch super (auch nach dem hei√üen Sommer).Sticker auf der R√ºckseite vom Handy ist -nat√ºrlich- abgenutzt. Daf√ºr sind sie nur bedingt geeignet.Sie lassen sich auch abl√∂sen (glatter Untergrund wie z. B. K√ºhlschrankt√ºr) und wieder aufkleben. (5 von 5*)"
R1X749OT9STU6R,"Au top, ma fille adore !","Bon, les recharges sont ch√®res, mais √ßa on le sait...Sinon, qualit√© d'impression suffisante pour le format, pratique d'utilisation."
R11F2XZI75140C,Color & Size,"I use natural light to take these pictures so you could see the exact blush color, and you could see what the outputs look like. You can also see the size comparative to my hand which is about 7"" long to the top of my middle finger"
R3V7K73EAHKTTO,Tut was es soll,"Die Erwartungen sollten nicht zu hoch sein, wer her Bilder in Fotolabor Qualit√§t erwartet ist an der falschen Adresse. Aber der Drucker tut auf jeden Fall was er soll und reicht auch f√ºr meine Zwecke. Die Qualit√§t des Drucks ist auch stark abh√§ngig von der Qualit√§t des Bildes und ich empfehle das Bild immer einen ticken heller zu machen als man es m√∂chte, da meinem Anschein nach der Druck etwas dunkler ausf√§llt. Ich w√ºrde mir noch mehr Auswahl an Rahmen in der App w√ºnschen, vorallem um einen Polaroid Effekt zu erzielen."
R2T166I6L0WCST,Relaci√≥n calidad-precio buena,Muy contenta con la impresora. La calidad de las fotos no es como si lo imprimes en una tienda de fotograf√≠a pero es perfecto para llevar de viaje y hacer un diario. Adem√°s no ocupa nada (lo mismo que un disco duro) y con la aplicaci√≥n es f√°cil de usar.
R3QDY4Y6AOWQU5,Obsessed ü§©,¬†Wow. This thing is so fun. I bought it to make labels üòÄ but for the price why not? I have a canva account & check out my outcome
RT8NMP2DJAPD0,Perfect for Journals,"I needed a medium quality wallet size photo printer to print movie posters for my journal/planner. I wanted something like this mostly because printing wallet sized photos is a pain from iOS. This seemed to fit the bill, plus it has sticker paper. I‚Äôve already used it for about 25 movie posters and so far the only complaint is when you are printing back to back, the unit will overheat and the app will ask you to pause your printing queue until it cools down. Other than that, a fun little printer!"
R3AHOKSTONJ8WL,Printing quality,Price is little bit high quality is very good
R3MLV7TLN9YFO7,GOOD,GOOD
R2RC76L32P12G7,Cannot see anything on the screen,How to on the printer.. cannot see anything on the screen.. are their any drivers?
R3NTMP1VNV5QEL,Drivers of Printer,"Product arrived today morning. However, drivers of printer is not found with the product. Pls resolve the issue"
R2OEE0HLSE3XUS,Printer stops working after 6 months and HP not responding to warranty calls! Absolute waste of 30k+,"Printer started showing print artefacts within a 100 prints and now no page is legible, colour or b&w.On hold with HP support for over a month and no response on my very much valid warranty claim.Absolutely do not buy. Waste of 30k+"
R2FH5HVLS0NRPC,NO Driver,"Not finding the driver in HP web site, kindly help the url to download"
R1C5FY3M8Q4YZU,Printer is Very Good and Robust,"But for 22k On Amazon is too much, I Visited the Local HP store and i found the same printer for 18k with same warranty.Search for the cheaper option but this is the best printr with LAN and Wifi Functions"
RUTROAS48VSZA,Product was delivered with no Amazon package.,¬†I didn't like the fact that there was no external Amazon box on this item. I looked forward for the big box which I could have used for storage purpose later.But the printer is impressive. And it was handled safely by the team because so far we have not faced many issues with this.Edit: The printing ink had issues. You'll have to contact hp tech support sooner and the guy said it could be that you get the original product but the cartridge could have been not a good one. So we are having issues with colour prints for the time being. Hopefully the new cartridges help and do the job well.

R1ZTTIN6QGV0LV,Excellent printer value for money..,Excellent printer value for money..
RNMB3L6ZT1QAZ,CD drive,Print is okay... I haven't received CD drive to install my laptop
R26Z5G5C3BUYI,Not at all satisfied....more of a pain than fun or satisfaction using the product.,"Highly user unfriendly. Everytime I get the printer ready to deliver a print or get a scan, it's a pain as so far every single time there are some or the other notifications which either denies printing or says 'scan not possible now'. Never expected such a product from HP. It's only the name that sells today.If I have to install and pre-installed everytime and download drivers and firmware and software thus ending up losing almost 45 mins to an hour for a work which should not take more than 5 mins at the most, what is the use of such a product and spending so much of hard earned money."
R2DLBXIL0DJABL,Awesome printer,"Bought the product with mixed feelings due to many negative reviews.After using the product, it appears the negative reviews are posted without any product knowledge or how the printer works."
R22YURYTPNP69E,New printer but does not print(updated),"It‚Äôs a new printer but it does print properly. After running all diagnostics and speaking with helpdesk, I am trying to return the product.The product was replaced and the new one works fine."
R1PK34E59YQ40R,Look for better,"Positives:1) Easy install and use, less weight/handy.2) hp app3) 3in1 is good (scanner, printer, photocopy)Negatives:1) Not value for money for occasional users.I bought it for school online class purpose to take prints but it‚Äôs expensive2) Poor customer care -tech support (launched case number but never get call until I tried them)3) Printer comes with demo cartridges for only 12 to 15prints (colour may be 12, B&W may be up to 16)as per customer care , we need to buy two cartridges separately (Rs1600),4) full cartridges may give less prints as well and no instructions (may be 300 to 450 as per others experience)5) Printer papers auto process sucks sometimes, (not often so far),6) I tried to take small size print from smartphones but size selection is intermittent and only  A4 was option (most of the time)My suggestion: if you don‚Äôt use printer daily, please don‚Äôt buy to save your cartridges cost (cartridges may get clotted if you don‚Äôt use ink often)"

R2L37JN9QDX6ML,Simply the BEST!!! A Real World Class Experience....,"The most confusing dilemma an user would face when looking for a printer - LASER OR INKJET.. A Question with a lot of sub-questions...1) INITIAL EXPENSE(High Product Expense) or AFTER PURCHASE EXPENSE(high ink costs)?2) Black & White or COLOR?3) Single Function or Multi Function?Before i start sharing my experience on this one, let me share my past, my previous printer experience- one of the most terrible and bitter experiences i had in my life and that too because of another world class company's product - EPSON ME 340 INKJET MULTIFUNCTION PRINTER..After doing extensive research on several brands(HP,Canon,Epson) and types(Laser and Inkjet) of printers, i made a most terrible  decision - to purchase EPSON ME 340. I don't believe in bad luck or fate..it was only because,i made some slight miscalculations or may be my whole research was on the wrong side.. :(My primary intention was to get a printer for home use- to satisfy my academic printing requirements. The reasons which influenced me in making my decision were1) At that time, EPSON was the only one supporting 3rd Party Ink Tanks, so less printing cost can be achieved and that too with a Multi Function Color Printer.2) The crooked salesman at my local IT shop cheated me by giving a false promise, that installing a 3rd Party Company tank won't affect my product's guarantee. he also said he had handled several similar cases without any issues..  I was totally trusting this guy...3) Last but not least..i was so much blindly obsessed with brand EPSON's reputation..Guess what happened? After spending an eye whooping amount of around 5600Rs (3800+ For Printer and 1800+ for ink tank),My printer stopped working just after 6 months of usage. When i called the IT shop, they totally refused their earlier words and offers in providing the assistance in claiming guarantee and they told me that it's main board of the printer that became faulty and in order to make it work again,i should spend another 3000+ and when i contacted company service, they refused to provide me guarantee due to additional modifications which i have made to the printer.. well i don't blame them, standard company regulations.. it was my fault to believe that crooked mind...NOW ABOUT THE PRESENT......After a year, due to heavy printing requirements(Final year project documentation,seminar, reference materials,etc) i thought of purchasing another printer again. This time i have made a firm decision at the beginning itself..i will purchase from a reputed online seller. After my detailed comparison tests and scrutinies, found 2 best devices to suit my needs- HP 2520hc and Canon Image Class MF 3010.Out of these two,i finally decided to go with canon because1) i have very good experience with two canon products before(canon ixus digital camera) and canon projector.2) Most of the other online sellers were offering these printers for prices near to their MRPs without any substantial discounts, but when i saw the price of canon MF 3010 @ amazon i was astonished.... around 24% discount to MRP...7650Rs instead of 9900Rs.Initial Experience--> Printing Quality is excellent...Very fast printing compared to slow inkjet printers(First paper out in less than 5-7 seconds)..Can't talk about toner mileage since i have printed only few papers..Scanning Quality is one of the best among this class of printers... An amazing feature i found in the copier other than normal copy is to select 3 modes-1) Paper Save(2 papers on one side) or Card Copier(to take the copies of small identity cards)2) Brightness adjustment(to set density of black color, by this way we can effectively increase the mileage of toner bin)3) Enlargement( could easily set the screen ration of the copying process either 50% to around 200%)The only con which i found in this printer so far is the absence of duplex printing feature (2 sided printing at the same time)..In overall i would definitely recommend this to any one looking for a home printer which could produce cheap prints..You can simply purchase it without even thinking...Because, that's the level of trust Canon is offering here... I'm Completely Satisfied... :)"

R38INXVQS3XG94,Corner of the Scanner glass damaged...,The product was actually perfect for my use. Pretty decent size with scanner. Demerit:-It don't have wifi connectivity. Price of the product was also decent. I received the product within one week. But when I unboxed the product it damaged (corner of scanner glass as mentioned in the picture)the box was not damaged at all. It was a perfect packing but may be manufacturing defect or idk whatever. I returned the product and got the refund within the day. Iam happy about that with Amazon customer service. Fine i will order another that's all my overall experience with the product through online

R2X1MFVP8L8WQH,value for money,printer is very good for home user
RBJ4X54JDLZM3,Great printer but overpriced on Amazon,"I bought this printer two years ago and last week the drum unit on my printer needed to be replaced after printing 11786 pages in the past two years, which is pretty accurate with what was promised (12000 pages).In the meantime, I used eight toners, which implies that this printer can on an average print 1500 pages with one original toner, which is not bad considering the price of the toner being on the lower side.On the operation side, the printer is pretty seamless with very rare occurrence of paper jam. My printer statistics says it occured only 30 times during the life the last drum.So I was looking for buying it again as I was in need of another printer. But the price on Amazon totally shocked me. Two years back I bought it for Rs 8999 which was not any special deal. Back then the MRP of the product was quite low. If I remember correctly it was in the tune of Rs 11000.Now seeing the 63% rise in the MRP I became quite suspicious. So, I look around on the website of Brother which lists it with a price of Rs. 13990. I asked around in the retail offline market and they said it is available for Rs 11500.So it makes no sense to buy it from Amazon with such a high price difference. I don't know how Amazon regulates the prices of the items on its platform, but by seeing all this I can definitely say that this needs to be fixed.Otherwise a great printer.Edit: While I wrote this review, MRP of the printer on Amazon was Rs. 17900 and it was being sold for Rs. 15000 on discount."
RYDYLA8H0RPQV,I will again look for Brother products,"The best laser printer. It looks like a heavy duty  printer. Speed is impressive. Japanese technology,  also it is a plug and play device. Very happy. Thanks Brother and Amazon deal."
R25F7I700JKQ3Z,One of the best Printers.,Brother HL-B2000D Mono Laser Printer is very good in performance.Very Fast and Duplex Printing.Thanks a lot to Amazon for the competitive price.
RS9AIAMI1RZVW,Lil expensive,but does the job
R2YHY9LE4TK0XM,Don‚Äôt buy ‚Ä¶.very costly refill and create huge problem,"¬†You cannot refill cartridge, every time you‚Äôve to buy new one so it will be more expensive and afford less"
R2O8J1O8X0SLVD,Almost Perfect With 1 Flaw,This is the perfect value for money double sided printer for home or small office printing if you want to use a USB connection.Only one con - the power cable is fixed to the printer.This is the first time I have ever seen a printer with a fixed power cable and I have literally used more than 3 dozen printers of all types from small inkjet to commercial level multi tray All in ones.Never seen one with a fixed cable.
R1NVE42TMJX58J,Five Stars,It is a best printer I ever seen
R3VJYS0WM8KXMK,Bad quality product!,The print quality is extremely disappointing. The test print we took from the sprocket was patchy and the whole setup process is also very tiresome.
R1SGH0DSSHJ69,Divertida pero con sus limitaciones,"¬†Estamos ante una impresora port√°til que es un concepto muy interesante ya que tener la posibilidad de poder revelar las fotos en pocos segundos, donde queramos ya que es de peque√±o tama√±o, ligera y nos cabe en cualquier sitio, la calidad de las fotos es solo aceptable desarrollo con m√°s detalle este punto un poco m√°s adelante.A m√≠ me personalmente me ha gustado mucho, desde la construcci√≥n que es muy buena, bien acabada con un gran acabado superficial. En cuando al dise√±o es muy bonita.Tiene un peso de solo 170 gramos, con unas dimensiones de 11,5 x 7,49 x 2,21 cm, es muy peque√±a.En cuanto a la calidad fotogr√°fica de las fotos a de decir que es media baja la verdad, los colores est√°n muy apagados en las pruebas, pero no est√°n mala del todo el problema est√° realmente en los colores que no son fieles a la realidad. Decir como contrapartida que la calidad de las fotos pensado que es un impresora sin tinta, con bater√≠a adem√°s de port√°til  est√° muy bien. La resoluci√≥n es de 313 x 400 DPI.Otro punto muy importante y que hay que tener en cuenta, es el tema del papel fotogr√°fico ZINK, que es un poco caro ya que 20 hojas nos costaran unos 12 Euros, con lo que cada foto saldr√° a unos 50 c√©ntimos de euro. Desde mi punto de vista es muy caro y esto sin tener en cuenta el precio de compra de la impresora de 150 euros.El tama√±o de las fotos es mini de 5 x 7,6 cm. Y el papel ZINK es adhesivo.La aplicaci√≥n m√≥vil para IOS y Android funciona muy bien y nos da muchas posibilidades de manejo.Pros:- Dise√±o, muy bonito.- Muy ligera.- Muy peque√±a y port√°til.- Manejo y sincronizaci√≥n muy sencilla, muy f√°cil de manejar.- Concepto de impresi√≥n muy bueno.- Divertida- Fotos adhesivas.- Bateria.Contras:- Cierta inestabilidad de conexi√≥n.- Precio de la impresora.- Precio de las fotos.- Calidad de las fotos media.- Colores apagados.Como conclusi√≥n, es la primera impresora port√°til de HP, y lo han hecho bien pero no es un producto redondo porque tiene sus pegas, creo que deben mejorar la calidad de color y de definici√≥n, pero creo que esto en pr√≥ximas versiones segura que mejorar, otro punto que no me gusta es el tema del precio de las fotos es muy alto a m√°s de 50 c√©ntimos, tambi√©n he de decir lo que me gusta es el concepto de impresi√≥n portable, que me parece un acierto, en general me gustan mucho la impresora, pero tiene sus problemas.Comentario de un producto cedido sin compromiso alguno con la tienda, comentario imparcial.Espero ayudarte en tu decisi√≥n, si crees que ha sido as√≠ te pedir√≠a que le dieras a SI."
RL5G8Q6VZNOFD,"Faster than ZIP, higher quality, compatible with Zink papers*","10 Words or Less:‚Ä¢ Faster than ZIP, higher quality, compatible with Zink papers*IMPORTANT:‚Ä¢ If you read just ONE thing, read this. DO NOT THROW OUT THE BLUE CARD in the starter paper pack! I repeat DO NOT THROW OUT THE BLUE CARD!‚Ä¢ Take a look at my photo and you‚Äôll see there are different kinds of blue cards that are included with paper. The blue card is read each time you insert a new pack and it tells the printer what paper is there. It is VERY IMPORTANT to know that the hp sprocket will only accept HP branded paper! This means you cannot use regular (cheaper) Zink Pogo paper or Zink Premium. How does the printer know what paper you have? The blue card.‚Ä¢ Whatever 2x3‚Äù Zink paper you buy, simply feed the ORIGINAL HP blue card instead of the one that came in the package. The printer will read it as hp sprocket paper and accept it. This is nothing more than manufacturers trying to limit the use to their own ‚Äúlicensed‚Äù paper. Now there IS a difference between the regular ‚ÄúPogo‚Äù paper and ‚ÄúPremium‚Äù but there is no difference between brands like ‚ÄúLG‚Äù or ‚ÄúHP‚Äù or ‚ÄúPolaroid‚Äù‚Ä¶ they are the same.The Good:‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs FAST! By fast I mean the spool up time to print is a full 20 seconds LESS than the Polaroid Zip.‚Ä¢ Quality is better‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the printer or the app, but the output is far better on the HP (in general). Polaroid Zip prints are generally much too dark, even after editing.‚Ä¢ The HP app is much more user friendly than the Polaroid ‚ÄúSnapTouch‚Äù app.The Bad:‚Ä¢ It‚Äôs slightly bigger than the Polaroid Zip.‚Ä¢ HP app does NOT have multi photo printing on one page. You have to use a third party app like PhotoGrid and then send the output to HP sprocket app. This is can be a hinderance from someone that likes to print 2-in-1 pics.‚Ä¢ Casing is very glossy so I suggest getting it in white if you don‚Äôt like to see fingerprint smudges.Comments and Last Thoughts:‚Ä¢ There are two kinds of paper: Regular (Zink Pogo), and Premium (Zink Premium, HP sprocket‚Ä¶etc). The latter is a little bit higher quality and more glossy. For me, the cost isn‚Äôt worth it for a print this size and how it‚Äôs going to be used anyway. I suggest going for the regular kind and buying in bulk if you want to save some money.‚Ä¢ If you‚Äôre looking for a decent price on Premium paper, look to the Apple Store or deals that happen on Best Buy and Amazon. YOU MUST KEEP THE ORIGINAL HP BLUE PAPER TO USE IT.‚Ä¢ For bulk papers, I‚Äôve purchased from Amazon regular Pogo (not Premium) papers like this:¬†"
R3E6UO3TT2BJHS,"Devil in the details: but still a lot of fun, and workable for branding an event","Just got it. Here are some (hopefully) time-saving tips and observations I 'learned' from test running this thing:First, there's no printed manual with this. Just a blue card instructing you to go to hpsprocket.com -- which is pretty thin in technical details, but there is a basic setup guide there. And the guide at that site is not all that well written either. For instance, I thought that the 'blue card' was the calibration card, but no -- that's inside the paper pack, the card in the box is just, I presume, a laughingly minimal compliance to supplying printed support material? (the QR code didn't even work!)Anyhow, when I did figure out how to open the unit to put the paper in, I saw the calibration card and made sure it was face down when inserting into the unit. Someone wisely suggested hanging onto this card and maybe adding something like 'Original Card [date of purchase]' on its back. That bar code is essentially the 'key' to allowing the printer to know that you've just inserted HP Brand Zink paper in it, even though there's no real difference between paper brands, but you need that card to 'hack' the printer into accepting other brand papers. (Might be worth making a copy and -- as a way to remind yourself to not throw it away, reinsert it to the top of the back after the printer does it's initial 'brand' testing of the card).After fully charing the Sprocket, I installed the software and added the device in my bluetooth settings on my Android Samsung Note 4. The device showed up no problem as a paired device, but when I clicked on it in the list to connect, nothing happened. It was paired, but not connected. A couple of hours later.... I had managed to update the firmware of the device (through the app settings) and I also learned that the connection is not made until actual print time. Ah! Major breakthrough! When I actually opened a phot in the app and hit print, it said it couldn't connect. Then when I opened the print queue, and hit print, it did connect, and print. Whew! So obviously, not all the bugs were killed in that firmware upgrade.In any case, I now had a workflow that... kind of worked.I also plan to use this at an event to promote good will, and a brand. I'm doing that by 'printing' through the Share button from an app called 'Add Watermark'. This app allows you to load up saved, customized PNGs as Watermarks, but to get a 'customized branded frame' for each print, I constructed a decorative border frame (with a logo and text on the bottom) and loaded it in as a watermark into Add Watermark and scaled it to fill side to side. As the Sprocket's print ratio is 2:3, and not one available on most cameras, the overlay frame (which is set to 2:3 ratio) gets instantly centered with one button push and reveals 'unframed' picture bottom and top. No worries, as the next step is to use the 'Share' button in Add Watermark to send it to the HP Sprocket app where it pops in fitting perfectly, ready to print.But print through the Print Queue button only, for some reason.Another lesson I learned is that you cannot 'compensate' for the drop in vividness of colours between screen and printout using the Sprocket App's brightness/contrast tweaks found in its 'Edit Image' controls. Best to get as crisp and bright as you would normally want in a print before passing oft to the Sprocket app, and just lower your contrast and colour expectations.Everyone I've shown the system to so far is next to incredulous of the printer's size and output quality. I expect this should work well for the event we have planned. And just as an overall fun, party toy.But HP needs to step up their game here (and most of their other products, from what I hear) for customer support service.And if I had a big druther -- I'd hope that they would update the Sprocket app to include importing of full colour PNG images (with transparency) as user supplied customized 'stickers' to work as customizes frames within that app (rather than the awkward workaround through a separate app). The ability to add a logo or a frame, text, or tagline to each print potentially transforms this little toy into a real charming, little pocket brand builder.To that end, be sure to consider creating a nice quality PNG file of your business card! The standard bus. card is 3.5 x 2 inches. That means these 'prints' from the Sprocket are just a half inch short, but they should fit in most people's card organizers. How about leaving an area left to throw in a selfi shot with your contact? Now that might make more of an unconscious impression than you would think. How many times have you tried to put a face to a business card? By using the selfie 'platform' you can instantly create a card with your face and your contact together. Personalized business cards? Hmm.Oh, everyone loves the sticker option on the prints too. Great little feature!Zink paper refills still baffles me. Why is it cheaper to buy three 20 packs than five 10 packs?"
R1WK4AH79CMRKG,Great until it wasn‚Äôt,"Bought this is September 2019. Reviewing in August 2022. This was a great option for printing photos for my journal. However the battery in the printer started giving out about a year in. I was able to keep it going until this summer where it began dying mid print. I have lost almost a 10 sheets of zink paper trying to troubleshoot. I checked the warranty on their site and it‚Äôs only valid for 16mts from manufacture? By the time I purchased this, I had 7 months left. I did some digging online and this isn‚Äôt an isolated issue for this version. Not sure the price is worth the short lifespan.Would like to note that the printer didn‚Äôt experience a rough life in my care, I was careful to keep it in a bag and protected.It‚Äôs unfortunate because it is a great printer. I just wouldn‚Äôt recommend you spend over 100 dollars on this product for it to be useless in 3 years.Disclaimer: I have so much zink paper, I decided to buy the next gen sprocket, with the pink sprinkles. It‚Äôs functionality is similar to the first gen, I wonder why they are still selling the first gen?"
R3Q8IKRO27A9MM,"Seamless set up, you will LOVE this!!!","I researched and looked at many portable printers for several months, before deciding on the HP sprocket. I wasn‚Äôt sure whether I should go with the sprocket or the plus but chose the original. I know that reviews can be biased,  as bad reviews can result when someone has an issue with software update, installing paper the correct way, etc. I tried not to let the ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt work‚Äù reviews dissuade me from my purchase and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt. If you go to the App Store, you will see many complaints about app and printer not working - apparently there was an app issue months ago that involved an update and a reset of phone and printer- very simple fix that hp addressed.I had viewed several YouTube videos so that when my sprocket arrived I was pretty familiar with what would be in the box and what I needed to do. So simple- remove cover of printer, put the pack of 10 sheets of paper in with the blue card at the bottom facing down (this calibrates the printer). Then, on your phone, install the app. From there, the app will ask you which device you have. Select it and it will walk you through each step, such as your photo roll and accessing your social media accounts if you‚Äôd like to (so make sure you know your usernames for Instagram and Facebook, etc) Make sure on you‚Äôre phone your blue tooth is turned on. I have an iPhone X and cannot tell you how seamless this was. It will tell you when printer and phone are paired. Done! I couldn‚Äôt believe how easy it is and - for the record- I am not the most tech savvy grape in the bunch, ha ha. If I could do it, anyone reading my review will be able to do it!  Then, give it a charge. You will see a red light. Red light means it‚Äôs charging. When the light is green, it‚Äôs charged. You‚Äôre good to go! If a software/ firmware update is needed the printer needs to be charged 50%. The printer needs to be charged a bit before printing out a picture so keep that in mind as well. I am over the moon with this, I‚Äôm so happy I bought it! I also purchased a little hard case to carry it in- and store my papers and charging cord, glad I decided to buy that too. Something to consider if you‚Äôre going to purchase this. If in the fence, I say go for it. The picture printed as I expected it to. Clear. Glossy. Perfect to capture a memory of an event or get together or to tuck into an agenda, wallet, card or journal! Love, love, love this!!! Hope this helps someone!"
R2V9VZPN9541SA,HP Sprocket for sketchbook and drawing,"I really like my HP Sprocket and I hope HP continues to support it. The App for this is really simple to use but they need more options because I have to use a third party app to have more editing options.So the printer itself is pretty swell. Don't expect amazing quality though, you gonna put most pictures though the editor to brighten/darken it to make it closer to the original. Also, dark lines aren't very consistent. I'm currently using this to print comics sections and artwork for my sketch book as reference and in one of the pictures I printed out before editing, it was suppose to be just black and white but the black lines were faded and kinda tinted purplish I think. Very light. In another drawing I printed, I used the editor and it came out a bit better. For such a large picture turned tiny, it got most of the details. Just the black lines were faded/light purplish in the thinner lines.BTW, I would suggest using this app for iOS users if you want to make sure all of your picture will fit in the 2:3 ration that the app uses: "">Resize"". It's free and pretty basic in the Apple App Store. Pretty much uses all of the paper and looks decent if you remain consistant. Oh, and you have to be using the latest iOS firmware of your device cause the HP decided to stop supporting those under 8.0 I think.So I'm not sure if the picture quality is the HP Sprocket's fault or the Zink Paper since they're both pretty new. I hope the paper becomes cheaper cause unless it's on a sale, it's about $0.50 per paper. The sticker part is really good though, picture feels smooth against my sketch book and doesn't come loose.So overall, if you just want some fun little pictures for your scrapbook/sketch book needs, I would suggest buying it since it seems like the best out of the other current printers of April 2017. It's very easy to connect it to your bluetooth and the app is simple to use as well. It's very portable and there are two cases for it right now for your basic needs of protection. There is also the benefit that since it uses Zink paper like Polaroid and LG, you could swap between the other brands as long as you keep your blue sheet from the HP set. Look it up on YouTube if you want proof.The only other recommendation I would give is the Kodak Mini Printer (PM-210). The pictures are a tiny bit bigger than a credit card and the quality is pretty good. Only problem is the cartiages as they are quite expensive unless you use another brand like ""Pickit"" which comes in non-sticker and sticker.I'll include a photo of my Sprocket with the two cases I'm using and a screenshot I printed from Person 5 the game."

R2AU6V6VZJX5TV,Hp Sprocket: una piacevole scoperta,"Ero rimasta incuriosita da questa stampante sentendone parlare gi√† prima del suo lancio e, soprattutto, ero spesso tentata nell'acquisto di una macchina fotografica instantanea. Ma l'Hp Sprocket ha superato tutte le aspettative.Appena aperto il pacco ho trovato questa stampante tascabile (poco pi√π larga di un normale smartphone), di colore nero e dalla finitura extra lucida elegante e sfiziosa, assieme ad una ricarica di carta fotografica.All'interno, nessun foglio di istruzioni: la Hp Sprocket, infatti, √® assolutamente intuitiva e di facilissimo utilizzo. Sul lato sinistro c'√® un tasto di accensione, mentre le spie posteriori indicano quando la stampante √® accesa (luce bianca) oppure necessita di essere ricaricata (luce rossa), con un cavo usb in dotazione. Per ricaricare la carta, invece, basta spingere leggermente il cassetto superiore con il pollice e inserire la carta con il lato blu rivolto verso il basso. Ho poi scaricato sul mio telefono l'app ""sprocket"" ed ecco la magia! Si possono prendere le foto dalla galleria del telefono o dai vari social, magari modificandola con filtri, testi, cornici o stickers! La stampa - che avviene tramite bluetooth - √® abbastanza veloce, su carta fotografica adesiva di 5x7,6 cm. La novit√† sta proprio nella carta: non esistono cartucce, perch√® grazie alla nuova tecnologia Zink l'inchiostro √® direttamente nella carta! La qualit√† √® buona e i colori sono nitidi e lucidi e mi sembrano anche parecchio resistenti, ma √® bene ricordare che si tratta di foto istantanee e che, pertanto, nella stampa la qualit√† un po' si abbassa. Se non ci si aspetta foto super professionali, dunque, l'Hp Sprocket rimane un'ottima scelta.Ho portato la mia Sprocket davvero ovunque: pranzi in famiglia, serate con amici, eventi pubblici e, soprattutto, ho stampato le sorprese da inserire nelle uova di cioccolato che ho realizzato quest'anno e, devo ammetterlo, tutti sono rimasti sbalorditi da queste piccole foto ricordo, tanto da voler conoscere e provare da s√® questa stampante.Ho usato talmente tanto la mia Sprocket che ho terminato quasi subito la carta a disposizione e ho quindi ordinato due ricariche nello store Hp (da cui si pu√≤ accedere direttamente dalla app). Anche in questo caso sono rimasta piacevolmente sorpresa, ho ricevuto il mio ordine in 24 ore!La mia esperienza con l'Hp Sprocket, quindi, √® assolutamente positiva e pi√π di qualche amico mi ha confessato di volerla acquistare tanto son rimasti incuriositi! Soddisfatta al 100%."
R1NS09DVIOSD5T,Good product,good and reliable printer
R20RMRV6LYKO5G,Read This Before You Buy!,"Warning! This printer does not have a built-in wireless adapter/radio. It does, however, have an Ethernet port. This means that you must connect an Ethernet cable from the printer to your network hardware (ex. a wireless router) in order for the printer to be accessible on your home/office network. This point was a bit ambiguous in the product description on both Amazon's and HP's sites. It would be easy for a buyer to think that it is a wireless printer, when that is not the case. Luckily, my wireless router happens to be in close range of my printer, so crisis averted :)Note: The¬†"

RYG8E886VDW1Y,Printing speed is xtreemly slow even slow than deskjet. Wastage of money.,Printing speed is xtreemly slow even slow than deskjet. Wastage of money.
R2E8WIV1UYTNPZ,Value for Money,"As most of you, i couldn't afford the costly printers, so went for this. It serves the purpose but a color picture is not the best how the costly printers do however it's not bad, it's okay. If you are looking for first time, you might not feel the difference."
R1B938ZCYSXGNW,Information about the prints is in correct.,On the box it‚Äôs written like thisupto 2600 black or 1400 colour pages.While here it‚Äôs shown as 2600 & 1400 pages.
R2NCGCELK4XKDJ,"Good printer, Complicated Installation!","After a day of fidgeting with the wifi settings and constantly getting disconnected, I was finally able to get the printer to work in USB mode. In this process, wasted 10 pages just to get it working.The printer comes with useless manuals, and expects you to print most of it. Recommend not using HP Smart - the software is a time waste.Build quality of printer is flimsy...can break easily...handle with care. I was used to my well built k209a.Out of the box, the printer is in wifi mode, and you end up wasting (printing) 1 page everytime the wifi direct password changes. It needs a wpa enabled router to work on lan.As the installation driver is no longer provided on CD, you need to download a 150~mb software from HP website - this enables USB direct printing. And you can disable wifi and internet printing. It also allows you to print and scan directly from Windows with bundled HP software (not HP Smart).Overall 4 star for the printer as it has plenty of features for the price point. But 2 stars for the installation and setup process."
R1L0VFZAOOW2QR,Print ek side jata hai,Colour print ka alignment thik nahi hai
R51STDNXIGJQ4,Good printer. Lowest ink price. Print speed/quality is average,"The printer (HP 4826) is nice.1) Printer price is high compared to the HP 2338 series, but makes up in ink cost.2) The colour ink (HP 47) claims 700 pages and costs Rs 475 at the time of writing, whereas most other HP inks costs Rs 800+ but gives only 180 pages! So, in the long run the cost of the printer will be recovered. However HP-47 is a new ink and only used by this printer now, so it may not as easily available as others.3) Can print wirelessly from mobile phone, laptop, desktop as long as they are on the same wired/wireless networkEasy to install.Print quality is acceptable on normal paper, although it looks quite a bit on the lighter side (to save ink/ speed?).If printing from PC, there is option to choose ‚Äúbest‚Äù print quality but it becomes really slow.Print alignment sheet comes after first 3 prints, which needs to be scanned for improving quality. Printing speed is average.Photo printing was OK-OK on JK photo paper.There were no clear instructions on the installation, try watching videos online. Here are the steps1) Open box, remove all blue plastic tapes. Open the paper in and out trays, adjust paper width by lifting the backside tab and pushing the width tab. Load few sheets of A4 paper. Insert the power cable.2) Turn on printer. Open cartridge door. Install both ink cartridges3) Install HP-smart app on mobile phone. The blue light on wireless will be blinking (setup mode, this lasts for 2 hours after first power up, so turn-on only when you are planning to install) With printer on and nearby (and within wireless router range) start installation process, follow instructions.4) Wireless network password would be asked, and also you would have to sign up for HP account.5) Try printing from mobile. Once the printer setup is over, the printer can be added on any Windows-10 PC by using ADD-Printer option in control panel. There is no need to install the HP software on PC, but it has some features, so it is recommended.Overall it an OK printer with an average to low speed vs quality, but promises low ink cost. It is aimed at home use only and will not satify a professional."
R1IIYZJYR5Z9LG,Nice printer,Nice and steardy printer for home purposes. Children school activities ect. Loved it
R1KP7Y91BCLDO8,good,like
R2KRMESPWTBZVK,Excellent.,All well. I used it for regular  personal requirement of b&w printouts as well as color photo prints. All wirelessly using my smartphone.  Expectedly the initial setup with the necessary app required some patience but then it was all smooth enough. All results are of  excellent quality . I like that It's lightweight too. To me the extra ink cartridges seem very convenient as in case a cartridge is used up you won't have to run for a replacement. First time I am using a personal printer at home but my experience with this printer is quite smooth & sweet.
R2MGG9ILAVZMMP,Very good printer and easy to use .,"¬†Print quality is good . It is easy to use , but i cannot send command through my pc , while sending the print command it is getting stuck through wifi , so i am using my phone to get the printouts , specially the wireless connectivity is very good , till now i have not faced any major problem , bought this printer last week . The cost of printing is very minimum which is the actual advantage of this printer . After searching on youtube i did not get any detailed video of this printer so i have to figure it out through the owner's mannual which is not so tough to understand . As per iso standards it is mentioned that the black and white cartridge can yield 2600 pages but they have not mentioned in which quality of printing either in draft or normal or  in best . I will prefer everyone to buy this printer , the price of the cartridge is also low when it is compared with other cartridges .By the way i got one hp gaming headphone for free with this printer , which nearly cost around Rs 1350 üòÄüòÄ and i trust hp because they try to give their best in each and every product . Using hp products since 2012 , still using my mouse , keyboard and monitor of hpwhich was brought in 2012 and also bought one hp pc but sold it because the processor and motherboard was too old to run new games and softwares , they provide products which are value for money or even more than that . A big fan of hp products ü§óü§ó. Thank you hp for providing such amazing products ."
R35Y4SPKWPS1XI,Wireless connectivity with this printer is a nightmare. Not recommended,"Bought this printer 10 days ago.

Connecting to Wifi is a trouble.2. The Hp Smart app does not allow you to print unless you register an account with HP. Not just that, every user and device - laptop and mobile has to register and be logged in to print.3. The account gets logged out everyday and have to relogin again.4. Installed HP Smart and drivers on my laptop. It asked me to login 3 times and enter the printer pin 2 times.5. When I logged into another user account on same laptop, I had to go through the same login processes again. Why HP why ????6. HP smart app does not have photo resizing option to fit to A4.

R2ZI8WSIKGOUXM,Good printer but difficult to configure for wireless connection,"Printer:It's meant for regular and perhaps heavy use.The amount of ink provided wouldn't be utilised even in many years with occasional use.It stopped working after about two and half years, perhaps because of low use (ink dried in the line and/or printer head). I would suggest to use the printer head cleaning software option once every few months if you are not using it regularly, to avoid having printer issues due to clogged lines due to dried ink.It doesn't print on both sides of the pages on its own. You have to print one page then feed it again manually if you want to print on both the sides, which is cumbersome.So, consider a printer with feature of duplex printing if you intend to print large no. of pages on regular basis, to avoid wasting paper by leaving one side unused.Photo printing:I tried it only for a few photos. Quality seems okay but not great. But I am no expert on this and I don't have much experience with photo printing at home.Scanner:it's good, no complaint about resolution/performance. However, S/w is not very user friendly.If the document is faded, it's difficult to choose the best mode from many scan modes available.Photocopier:works well - both colour and black & White modes.OnsiteGo Warranty (purchased along with printer)I had taken extended warranty for 2 years from OnsiteGo which repaired it free of any charges.Their service was very smooth and convenient as they picked it and delivered to my home after a day or two.So, it was a quick and convenient service.The only issue I came across with OnsiteGo is that their pick up guy didn't have any Identity card or authorisation letter from the company, so it was difficult to ascertain the authenticity of the service person whlle allowing him to take the printer away. It caused some inconvenience but I handed over the unit after some phone calls and email exchanges with the support team.I would recommend to go for OnsiteGo warranty particularly for items like printers, so that you get door step service in case of need. Overall, it was good experience with them."
R1TV8O3NYJ0WIS,You can buy,It produces noise a lot but printing quality is fine. Not that well when comes to printing on glossy papers.
R2O0FJLW1WSW1C,Good build quality but received defective item,I was so happy for this purchase. It prints good but when connected with wifi ( after many unsuccessful attempts) it doesn't recognise A4 sheet papers.When i tried with Legal paper it works fine ( printer detects it as A4 )But not recognising A4 as A4.This is 2016 model if I'm not wrong got great reviews but please think about this - even if they sell refurbished goods as new how would we know.Tip of the day: If u want a printer try newer models from your own interested brands.Much better to visit store directly  and buy after checking working condition instead of dealing with purchasing - waiting - unboxing - getting disappointed - again working on return process - waiting for it to be collected.

RTBPBXA5IYWEE,Worst printer. High maintainance cost.,"I am giving this review after using this printer for a month and it's a genuine problem, I am facing.According to Hp support, after your cartridge gets empty, you have to buy a new toner for this printer, as this is a chip oriented printer. & That will cost to you minimum Rs.3000 So that will result in high maintainance cost for a buyer.According to local market experts, they can help you in changing the chip worth rs. 1000 or more but that won't give you the guarantee that it will work properly in your printer or not.So I won't suggest anyone to buy this printer."

Initially you might face difficulty in installation. It's better to call hp and get installation support. They do it with remote connection."
RZOQFNDZYSUUS,It is not at all affordable printer,"I have a very bad experience after purchasing this HP Laser Printer 108W  model, the reason because once the toner ink gets finished then there is no option for cartridge/toner refill option to this printer model and all together the only option left over is purchasing the new HP toner which will cost you around 3000/-. Ideally the cartridge  refill should not cost more than 200-300 rupees for any other HO Laser printer model.The fact of no refill option was totally hidden when I purchased it through online from Amazon.Even the HP service denied to resolve my issue even though the printer model is in within the warranty period.  Inspite all my concern and documents provided with the Amazon  the issue is yet to resolve.Now with"

R1MZFAG48WR9LM,good printer,good printer at this price point. also saves space for small table.
R3NPMO2949ERR,"A very good printer, comparable to HP1020","Good Laser printer - almost as good as HP 1020. Printing speed probably slightly slower, but not really noticeable. Printing quality as good as HP 1020. At around Rs 5000 (it is often available at that price, with discount) it's a steal. If you are having a printer at your home, or if you run an office with 10-15 employee, this printer or HP 1020 are the ideal ones to have. There is not much long-term maintenance required.I don't suggest that you buy those all-in-ones, unless you routinely need to scan. If you print a large amount of black-and-white document, this one is the ideal printer. Single-function, laser printers are so much better than multi-function deskjet ones."

R2M8A6AXGZRXGM,Won't recommend,It's not the perfect printer. Not worth for the amount I paid ~10k INR. Nothing special for 10k. Can get similar features for less price. I won't recommend it to anyone. Also there is no return policy for this product. Don't waste your money.

R1QIO9K8L6WKP6,Do not buy if you are considering print Good Quality,"I ordered this product on 14th Nov they delivered me on 16th Nov afternoon .Because it will print 1300 pages as HP says single cartridge they Reduce the print Quality at that such extent that its print quality is very bad . I give 1 out 5 for print Quality .Scan quality also not good , it was HP 11K product at one time. it does not match this price , which Print and Scan Quality output it was giving on as a new printer .For rest thing I can say it is ok ."
R13TWNB08KRP25,HP Deskjet 2622 all in one printer.there is problem in connecting with wyfy r.,Product is good and it worked perfectly till now.

R34KCAGYQ6KOT,Cartridge problem,Cartridge gets over pretty fast....50-60 pages and thats it...not for a regular userShould have read the reviews before buying this....
R2VHHBIRJ3YK4G,How many color and black and white prints can be provided by the printer one cartidges,The good printer which can be use easily but the most dislike is the distributor provide the almost finished cartridges...
R2CJWF3M4F8A4A,Installation manual,Print quality is good. But installation is very slow. We are not able to get the details.
RPJ53AG6Q2JVO,Good,this product is good.......... but this ink price is very high.............if you buy this hp805 ink4times you can buy this printer second time.......but the wire is short........but product is not bad ........ good.
R37I1OD0G41A8O,Nice buy,Good printer for personal use. No problem with connectivity and print quality. But the only issue is that theink get used very faster.
R2V93SY62E3MX4,Good one,Couldn't really pair using mobile but was able to pair with Mac using wifi Direct. Very limited instructions provided. Had to press a few buttons to print out instructions stored in the printer itself. So took some time to figure it out. Connection using usb was instantaneous. Works just fine. Cartridge was included and printer displays cartridge left. Happy with it for now.
R11J3ZXLVRUUTJ,Simple and best for home use,Weightless Easy to fix cartridge and simple steps to installed driver but unlike thing is still could not able to print wireless even though after installing app
R2WR6O071F1NA3,Ink is expensive,Printer is good but the cartridges gets over very fast. The Tri color cartridges was used up after printing around 12 pcs of A4 size paper on single page per paper and the ink is quite expensive. Even though the printer is good but due to the above reason will not recommend anyone.
R1WQVLU1VFMP3P,NEVER go for this,"NOT as per the mentioned in the description. There are many other options to go for BUT this. The best thing I could say about this; is it has printed 5 pages at one go. Now you can consider it ""sarcasm"" or whatever."
R1FM7EZ523GPDD,But only if you can compensate the cost of cartilage,Printer is good very goodBut print cost per page is very highI have not got any cd for the installation of driverIt can print approx 160 colour and 180 black
R2K6F9XTWJ6OU9,connectivity issues,good quality print. but connectivity issues arises sometimes. capability to be added as a network printer. hp service is real good. when a problem occurred to the scanner they came and changed the scanner assembly. 1 disadvantage is the printer ink is costly and it will be finished very fast.
RIU0CUT4GSG43,Cartidge is very costly,When i purchased they told we can print 500 copies and we have printed only 100copies and it is showing cartidge is over
RRH5UPAWL9VVH,Best printer in this price segment!,I am giving this review after using it for 1 month and I will definitely say this printer is fabulous and the quality of the prints are also very good but it's little bit hard to install but won't worry you can install it via the manual Guide provided to you.
RN23XRE60W6BZ,Good printer with defected free cartridge,I liked the printer for the price and quality. But the free cartridge which I received with the printer was defected. And had to buy a new cartridge. So just because of the black cartridge I wasted my 3 days thinking y the prints r not clear. And when I gave the colour ND black and white print separately I figured that the black cartridge is a defect that the seller has given me.
